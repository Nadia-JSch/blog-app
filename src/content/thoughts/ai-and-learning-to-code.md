I'll be honest — I think about this a lot.

Every few weeks there's a new headline about AI writing code, passing technical interviews, building entire apps from a prompt. And every time I read one, there's this quiet knot in my stomach. Am I learning a skill that's about to become obsolete? Am I running toward something that's running away from me?

## The fear is real

I'm not going to pretend it isn't. When you see tools generating functional code in seconds, it's hard not to wonder where that leaves someone who's still figuring out array methods and debugging CSS layouts. The job market already feels competitive. Adding AI to the mix makes it feel like the ground is shifting under your feet.

I don't think anyone who's early in their coding journey — or even mid-career — is being irrational for worrying about this. It's a reasonable response to genuinely uncertain times.

## And yet, I keep going

Here's the thing though. I'm still on freeCodeCamp almost every day. I'm still working through JavaScript challenges, building projects, reading docs. Not because I've figured out some ironclad argument for why AI won't replace developers. I haven't.

I keep going because programming is genuinely fascinating to me. There's something about the problem-solving, the logic, the moment when something finally clicks after an hour of confusion — that feeling is real and it's mine. AI can't experience that. I can.

## What I actually think

My honest take? I think the landscape is going to change, probably a lot. But I also think:

- **Understanding code still matters.** Even if AI writes more of it, someone needs to know what it's doing, catch its mistakes, and make decisions about architecture and design.
- **Learning to code teaches you how to think.** That skill transfers everywhere — AI or no AI.
- **The people who understand both the tech and the human side will be valuable.** Maybe more valuable than ever.

## The contradiction I'm living with

So yes, I'm scared. And yes, I'm still learning. Those two things coexist in me every day and I've stopped trying to resolve the contradiction. Maybe the right move isn't to have it all figured out. Maybe it's just to keep showing up, keep building, and stay curious about where this all goes.

If you're feeling the same way — you're not alone. Keep going.
