I think about AI a lot - especially when reviewing JavaScript principles and grinding on freeCodeCamp, taking notes about `Math.floor()`. 

I don't know whether this road is still worth the investment of time when I feel outpaced by AI by a laughable leap. It's like being a couch potato trying to out pace an F1 car. 

## Racing against the machine?

I take the slow steps in silence to push my skills forward by 1 cm at a time while machines can cover kilometers in seconds (in a coding sense).

Developers won't be hand-coding apps, but maybe assessing the quality and functionality of AI-generated code. The role of developer is changing but you still need to understand enough to debug and tell the AI what to do. I fear this won't be the case for too long. Maybe a year or two until models start doing more heavy lifting with less oversight as agents become more reliable and able to work for days at time without much context rot or human oversight.

## Outlook 

I find computers and coding fascinating. Concepts that finally click into place, getting insights, sharpening my logic – that's what pushes me forward. Knowing more means having the toolset to create things where coding is a means rather than end goal. 

So I keep learning the basics to improve my skills and understanding despite what will be a disruptive and unpredictable career path over the next decade. Having human-centric skills like communication will matter and I'm trying to approve my soft skills too. It's exciting, but super scary.
